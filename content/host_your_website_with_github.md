### Creating the website
In order to host your site on GitHub, you first need the html file for your website.
To do this, create a new file named index.html and open it with your prefered text or code editor. Now you can write some simple HTML code in there for your website and hit save.
If you don't know how to write HTML, just copy my code for now or look at some tutorials online.

### Uploading the file to GitHub
Now that you have your website code, login to your github or create a new account. Follow the steps until your reach a site similar to this.

![Create GitHub Repository](imgs/upload_to_github/Screenshot-1.png)

Where it says 'create repository', give your repository a name, click on public and click 'create repository'.
Now when you're redirected to this page, click on 'upload an existing file' and follow the steps. Then click commit changes.

### Hosting your website code
You should now be on this page, where you can see the code for your repository.
Now on the top, click on settings, pages and under 'branch' change the selection from 'None' to 'main' and hit save.

Wait a bit, then hit refresh. At the top, there should be some text with a URL to your new website, go click on it. <br>If the text doesn't display, keep waiting and refreshing.

And there you have it. Your very own website. <br>Notice how it has your username and 'github' in the name. If you have a custom domain, you can input it in the same page settings under 'custom URL'. 
But that's going to cost you something.
