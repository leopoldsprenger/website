Even in 2024, the best way to showcase your work is still a website. Here are 5 reasons why you should have a website.

### #01 Personal Portfolio
A website is the best way to have a custom and controlled environment that represents you and your work. Even building the website itself showcases your technical skills. You can control every bit of the website’s design and functions and also choose what people should see about you and your work at any time. Your website can function as an introduction to you that you can give to someone, like a resume.

### #02 SEO and Google
When a potential business partner or future employer is trying to get an impression of you, they usually search for you on Google. And what is the first thing that pops up on Google? A website! Having a website means you can control the first search result they will most likely see about you. Making that as custom and tailored to your wishes as possible is worth the effort.

### #03 Credibility and Trust
Establishing trust with the people you meet is key. A well-designed website tells people about your technical skills and professionalism. People can view your background and previous works with transparency, helping to build trust and credibility. Extra points if you include testimonials from your previous business partners in your portfolio.

### #04 No Algorithm for Content
Unlike social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter (X), Facebook, or LinkedIn, you are not limited by how and if the algorithm shows your content to people. You can decide for yourself when people will see what content, and it's far more customizable than any social media profile.

You also won’t be negatively affected if the social media platform you're on changes its terms and conditions, or even if it shuts down. As long as the server running your website works, your website continues to exist, separate from big companies and their algorithms.

### #05 Sell Products and Courses
There is one thing that you can do better on your website than on any social media platform: sell products and services. Sure, you can include links to products in your bio or description, but where will they bring your followers? To a website.

So why not control the entire process and make the landing pages for your products optimal for your audience, ensuring they get the value they deserve and are more likely to follow through with the transaction?
