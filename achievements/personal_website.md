I made this personal website mainly to learn HTML, CSS and a bit of javascript. I can now also use it to upload content and achievements to the web.
This was my first time working with HTML, CSS or javascript.

This is the current home page.

I used 4 different html files each for one part of the site:
index.html, about.html, content.html and achievements.html

Since I had absolutely no idea on how to start, I used a mixture of documentation, youtube tutorials and ChatGPT 3.5's coding feature to get an initial setup running on github.
I then populated the site with the first few text fields, images and pieces of content, like this content piece right here.
This website will serve as my hub for creating and showcasing different projects.
